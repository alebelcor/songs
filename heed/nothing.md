(Intro)

D  E  F#m
D  E  F#m

(Verse 1)

F#m             C#m
Followed by the morning breeze
        D             F#m
In the sun I rest my head
F#m             C#m
Thinking of the memories
     D                   C#    C#7
And times we had in the past, dream

(Chorus)

D          E             F#m
No one can live life in loneliness
       D           E       F#m
Only stars in the sky far away...
         D           E         F#m
In the void there's nothing to say or embrace
        D        E            F#m
Empty souls are lost deep in there
        D       E          F#m
Like astray in time and in space

(Verse 2)

F#m            C#m
Walking in the sands of life
           D                 F#m
Where the lost will burn his feet...
F#m                C#m
Suffering from sad melodies
          D                 C#  C#7
Chanting life can never be the same now...

(Chorus)

D          E             F#m
No one can live life in loneliness
       D           E       F#m
Only stars in the sky far away...
         D           E         F#m
In the void there's nothing to say or embrace
        D        E            F#m
Empty souls are lost deep in there
        D       E          F#m
Like astray in time and in space

(Guitar solo)

D  E  F#m
D  E  F#m

(Bridge)

D        E          F#m
In the heart of a strange and wild moon
            D          E          F#m
There's a brave light shining for all
      D       E          F#m
The thing of knowing the end of a life
          D         E         F#m     E   F  G  Am
Gives us time for heeding the call, dream on

(Chorus)

F          G             Am
No one can live life in loneliness
       F           G       Am
Only stars in the sky far away...
         F           G         Am
In the void there's nothing to say or embrace
        F        G            Am
Empty souls are lost deep in there
        F       G           Am
Like astray in time and in space

(Outro)

      F           G          Am
In a void there's nothing to say
        F        G            Am
Empty souls are lost deep in there
