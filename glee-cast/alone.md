[Intro]

Bm  G  A  A7/G
Bm  G  A  F#7

[Verse 1]

Bm            G                A
   I hear the ticking of the clock
    A7/G            Bm           G   A  F#7
I'm lying here the room's pitch dark
Bm            G              A
   I wonder where you are tonight
    A7/G         Bm        G  A  F#7
No answer on the telephone

[Bridge]

         G            D/F#      Em  D
And the night goes by so very slow
      G                 D/F#  Em   A
Oh I hope that it won't end though
  D
Alone

[Chorus]

Em       C    G           D        Em
   Till now I always got by on my own
C               G          D
I never really cared until I met you
Em  C              G           D
      And now it chills me to the bone
Bm        C        D
How do I get you alone
Bm        C        D
How do I get you alone

[Verse 2]

Bm                 G               A
   You don't know how long I have wanted
    A7/G                Bm        G  A  F#7
To touch your lips and hold you tight, yeah
Bm                 G               A
   You don't know how long I have waited
    A7/G        Bm           G   A  F#7
And I was gonna tell you tonight

[Bridge]

         G        D/F#     Em
But the secret is still my own
 D         G              D/F#      Em  A
Oh and my love for you is still unknown
  D

Em       C    G           D        Em
   Till now I always got by on my own
C               G          D
I never really cared until I met you
Em  C              G           D
      And now it chills me to the bone
Bm        C        D
How do I get you alone
Bm        C        D
How do I get you alone
