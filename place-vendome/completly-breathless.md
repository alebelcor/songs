(Verse 1)

C             Am           Em    G
  Without you... I cannot dream
C             Am            Em    G
  The surface... is out of reach

(Bridge)

 F          Am       G
Deeper and deeper I fall

(Chorus)

                Dm       F
If this is the last goodbye
                 Am     C
I'm leaving my heart behind
           Dm            F                 Am
Wherever I go beyond tonight, the dark is endless
                Dm       F
If this is the last goodbye
                 C                Am
I swear I will change the end of time
             Dm                 F
Whatever you do, you're leaving me
             Am       G F Am   G F
Completely breathless

(Verse 2)
C              Am               Em    G
  I feel naked... I have no defense
C               Am                 Em    G
  It feels like... you're my only chance

(Bridge)

 F          Am       G
Deeper and deeper I fall

(Chorus)

                Dm       F
If this is the last goodbye
                 Am     C
I'm leaving my heart behind
           Dm            F                 Am
Wherever I go beyond tonight, the dark is endless
                Dm       F
If this is the last goodbye
                 C                Am
I swear I will change the end of time
             Dm                 F
Whatever you do, you're leaving me
             Am
Completely breathless

(Verse 3)

Am                      G
   I cannot take anymore
                        F
Broken down on the floor
                  F
Say will you be here tomorrow?
Am                     G
   Totally empty inside
                            F
Got all the reasons to fight
                  F              Dm   F   Am   C
So tell me is this our last goodbye?

(Outro)

           Dm            F                 Am
Wherever I go beyond tonight, the dark is endless
                Dm       F
If this is the last goodbye
                 C                Am
I swear I will change the end of time
             Dm                 F
Whatever you do, you're leaving me
             Am
Completely breathless
