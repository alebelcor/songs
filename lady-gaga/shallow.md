[Intro]

Em7  D/F#  G
C    G D
Em7  D/F#  G

[Verse 1]

Em7        D/F#        G
   Tell me somethin', girl
C                        G       D
   Are you happy in this modern world?
Em7      D/G#      G
   Or do you need more?
C                                  G         D
   Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

[Bridge]

Em7 D/F# G
I'm fallin'
C
   In all the good times
   G      D          Em7 D/F# G
I find myself longing... for change
C                            G      D
   And, in the bad times, I fear myself

[Interlude]

Em7  D/F#  G
Em7  D/F#  G

[Verse 2]

Em7         D/F#       G
   Tell me something, boy
C                          G         D
   Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Em7      D/F#      G
   Or do you need more?
C                           G       D
   Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

[Bridge]

Em7 D/F# G
I'm fallin'
C
   In all the good times
   G      D          Em7 D/F# G
I find myself longing... for change
C                            G      D
   And, in the bad times, I fear myself

[Chorus]

    Am                 D
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
 G         D/F#        Em
I'll never meet the ground
 Am                         D
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
       G             D/F#   Em
We're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus]

Am        Am/G    D/F#
   In the sha-ha, sha-hallow
G         D/F#           Em
   In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
Am        Am/G    D/F#
   In the sha-ha, sha-hallow
       G            D/F#   Em   Em
We're far from the shallow now

[Bridge]

Bm  D  A  Em
Bm  D  A

[Chorus]

    Am                 D
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
 G         D/F#        Em
I'll never meet the ground
 Am                         D
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
       G             D/F#   Em
We're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus]

Am        Am/G    D/F#
   In the sha-ha, sha-hallow
G         D/F#           Em
   In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
Am        Am/G    D/F#
   In the sha-ha, sha-hallow
       G            D/F#   Em   Em
We're far from the shallow now
