(Intro)

E  B A
C#m B A

E
Lying beside you
B            A
Here in the dark
 C#m           B             A
Feeling your heartbeat with mine
E
Softly you whisper
B            A
You're so sincere
C#m            B           A
How could our love be so blind?

(Bridge)

    F#m
We sailed on together
    C#m
We drifted apart
 B   E        B
And here you are
     A     B A
By my side

(Chorus)
B7        E
So now I come to you
     G#m
With open arms
 A
Nothing to hide
   D            B7
Believe what I say
  E
So here I am
     G#m
With open arms
A
Hoping you'll see
           D            B7
What your love means to me
      E
Open arms

(Interlude)

E  B A
C#m B A

E
Living without you
B         A
  Living alone
C#m         B            A
This empty house seems so cold
E
Wanting to hold you
B              A
  Wanting you near
C#m         B        A
How much I wanted you home

(Bridge)

    F#m
But now that you've come back
        C#m           B
Turned night into day
E   B        A     B A
I need you to stay

(Chorus)

(Outro)

E  D C#m
A B E
