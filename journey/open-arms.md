(Intro)

D  A G
Bm A G

D
Lying beside you
A            G
Here in the dark
 Bm            A             G
Feeling your heartbeat with mine
D
Softly you whisper
A            G
You're so sincere
Bm             A           G
How could our love be so blind?

(Bridge)

    Em
We sailed on together
    Bm
We drifted apart
 A   D        A
And here you are
     G     A G
By my side

(Chorus)
A7        D
So now I come to you
     F#m
With open arms
 G
Nothing to hide
   C            A7
Believe what I say
  D
So here I am
     F#m
With open arms
G
Hoping you'll see
           C            A7
What your love means to me
      D
Open arms

(Interlude)

D  A G
Bm A G

D
Living without you
A         G
  Living alone
Bm          A            G
This empty house seems so cold
D
Wanting to hold you
A              G
  Wanting you near
Bm          A        G
How much I wanted you home

(Bridge)

    Em
But now that you've come back
        Bm            A
Turned night into day
D   A        G     A G
I need you to stay

(Chorus)

(Outro)

D  C Bm
G A D
