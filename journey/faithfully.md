(Intro)
B  G#m  F#  E

         B
Highway run
         G#m
Into the midnight sun
  E
Wheels go round and round
               B   B
You're on my mind

           B
Restless hearts
        G#m
Sleep alone tonight
 E
Sendin' all my love
           F#
Along the wire

      E
They say that the road
      C#m                  B
Ain't no place to start a family
E               G#m
Right down the line
                  B
It's been you and me
     E             G#m
And lovin' a music man
                            B
Ain't always what it's supposed to be

(Bridge)
F#           D#m  F#
Oh girl you stand by me
      C#m      D#m E
I'm forever yours
Faithfully

(Interlude)
B  G#m  F#  E

         B
Circus life
          G#m
Under the big top world
E
We all need the clowns
            B
To make us smile
                   B
Through space and time
        G#m
Always another show
 E
Wondering where I am
        F#
Lost without you

      E               G#m           B
And being apart ain't easy on this love affair
 E                      G#m           B
Two strangers learn to fall in love again
E            G#m
   I get the joy
        B
Of rediscovering you

(Bridge)

(Interlude)

(Outro)
B  G#m  F#  E
