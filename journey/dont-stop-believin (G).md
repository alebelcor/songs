[Intro]

G  D  Em  C
G  D  Bm  C

[Verse 1]

G           D
   Just a small town girl
Em               C
   Livin' in a lonely world
G                D                   Bm     C
   She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
G          D
   Just a city boy
Em                      C
   Born and raised in south Detroit
G               D                   Bm     C
   He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

[Interlude]

G  D  Em  C
G  D  Bm  C

[Verse 2]

G                  D
   A singer in a smoky room
Em                       C
   A smell of wine and cheap perfume
G                         D
   For a smile they can share the night
        Bm              C
It goes on and on, and on, and on

[Bridge]

  C
Strangers waiting
G
   Walking down the boulevard
       C                        G
Their shadows searching in the night
   C
Streetlights, people
G
   Living just to find emotion
C                        D  G  D G C
Hiding somewhere in the night

[Interlude]

G  D  Em  C

[Verse 3]

G                   D
   Working hard to get my fill
Em            C
   Everybody wants a thrill
G                      D
   Payin' anything to roll the dice
     Bm        C
Just one more time
G                D
   Some will win, some will lose
Em                    C
   Some were born to sing the blues
G                 D
   Oh, the movie never ends
        Bm             C
It goes on and on, and on, and on

[Bridge]

  C
Strangers waiting
G
   Walking down the boulevard
       C                        G
Their shadows searching in the night
   C
Streetlights, people
G
   Living just to find emotion
C                        D  G  D G C
Hiding somewhere in the night

Streetlights, people

 G            D
Don't stop believin'
