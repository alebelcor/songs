[Intro]

E  B  C#m  A
E  B  G#m  A

[Verse 1]

E           B
   Just a small town girl
C#m              A
   Livin' in a lonely world
E                B                   G#m    A
   She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
E          B
   Just a city boy
C#m                     A
   Born and raised in south Detroit
E               B                   G#m    A
   He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

[Interlude]

E  B  C#m  A
E  B  G#m  A

[Verse 2]

E                  B
   A singer in a smoky room
C#m                      A
   A smell of wine and cheap perfume
E                         B
   For a smile they can share the night
        G#m             A
It goes on and on, and on, and on

[Bridge]

  A
Strangers waiting
E
   Walking the boulevard
       A                        E
Their shadows searching in the night
   A
Streetlights, people
E
   Living just to find emotion
A                        B  E  B E A
Hiding somewhere in the night

[Interlude]

E  B  C#m  A

[Verse 3]

E                   B
   Working hard to get my fill
C#m           A
   Everybody wants a thrill
E                      B
   Payin' anything to roll the dice
     G#m       A
Just one more time
E                B
   Some will win, some will lose
C#m                   A
   Some were born to sing the blues
E                 B
   Oh, the movie never ends
        C#m            A
It goes on and on, and on, and on

[Bridge]

  A
Strangers waiting
E
   Walking the boulevard
       A                        E
Their shadows searching in the night
   A
Streetlights, people
E
   Living just to find emotion
A                        B  E  B E A
Hiding somewhere in the night

[Chorus]

 E            B
Don't stop believin'
C#m                A
   Hold on to the feelin'
   E           B     G#m  A
Streetlights, people

 E            B
Don't stop believin'
C#m      A
   Hold on
   E          B    G#m  A
Streetlights, people

 E            B
Don't stop believin'
C#m                A
   Hold on to the feelin'
   E          B    G#m  A
Streetlights, people
