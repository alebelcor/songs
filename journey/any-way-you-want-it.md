G
Any way you want it
D
That's the way you need it
Em                  C
Any way you want it

G
   She loves to laugh
D
   She loves to sing
Em                     C
   She does everything

G
   She loves to move
D
   She loves to groove
Em                             C
   She loves the lovin' things

(Bridge)
G                 D
   Ooh, all night, all night
Em                 C
   Oh, every night
G               D
  So hold tight, hold tight
Em                       C
   Ooh, baby, hold tight
Oh, she said

(Chorus)
G
Any way you want it
D
That's the way you need it
Em                  C
Any way you want it
           G
She said, Any way you want it
  D
That's the way you need it
Em                  C
Any way you want it

G
   I was alone
D
   I never knew
Em                         C
   What good love could do
 G
Ooh, then we touched
D
   Then we sang
Em                         C
   About the lovin' things

(Bridge)

(Chorus)

(Solo)
G  D  Em  C
G  D  Em  C
