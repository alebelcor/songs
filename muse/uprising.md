[Verse 1]

Dm
   Paranoia is in bloom
      Gm              F
The PR transmissions will resume
              A
They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
             Gm                       F      A7
And hope that we will never see the truth around
(So come on)

[Verse 2]

Dm
   Another promise, another seed
       Gm                        F           E7
Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
           A
And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
           Gm                      F      A7
And endless red tape to keep the truth confined
(So come on)

[Chorus]

Dm            Gm    F
They will not force us
A                 Gm  F  A7
They will stop degrading us
Dm                Gm  F E7
They will not control us
A             Gm  F  A7
We will be victorious
(So come on)

[Verse 3]

Dm
   Interchanging mind control
            Gm           F
Come let the revolution take its toll
            A
If you could flick the switch and open your third eye
              G                      F       A7
You'd see that we should never be afraid to die
(So come on)

[Verse 4]

Dm
   Rise up and take the power back
             Gm                F     E7
It's time the fat cats had a heart attack
             A
You know that their time's coming to an end
          Gm                    F      A7
We have to unify and watch our flag ascend
(So come on)

They will not control us
A             Gm  F  A7
We will be victorious
