(Intro)

Am   G   F   E
Am   G   F   E

(Verse 1)

               Am
Is our secret safe tonight?
            G
And are we out of sight?
             F                    E
Or will our world come tumbling down?

(Verse 2)

                   Am
Will they find our hiding place?
             G
Is this our last embrace?
              F
Or will the walls start caving in?

(Bridge)

F                                                            Am
It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it should have been right
                                                         G
It could be wrong, could be wrong, to let our hearts ignite
                                                      F
It could be wrong, could be wrong, are we digging a hole?
                                                      F
It could be wrong, could be wrong, this is out of control
                                                 Am
It could be wrong, could be wrong, it can never last
                                                   G
It could be wrong, could be wrong, must erase it fast
                                                            F
It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it could have been right

It could be wrong could be....

(Chorus 1)

F              C
Love is our resistance
                                                    G
They keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down
Am                      G         F      E
Hold me, our lips must always be sealed

(Interlude)

Am   G   F   E

(Verse 3)
                Am
If we live our life in fear
              G
I'll wait a thousand years
         F              E
Just to see you smile again
                       Am
Kill your prayers for love and peace
                  G
You'll wake the thought police
          F
We can't hide the truth inside

(Bridge)

F                                                            Am
It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it should have been right
                                                         G
It could be wrong, could be wrong, to let our hearts ignite
                                                      F
It could be wrong, could be wrong, are we digging a hole?
                                                      F
It could be wrong, could be wrong, this is out of control
                                                 Am
It could be wrong, could be wrong, it can never last
                                                   G
It could be wrong, could be wrong, must erase it fast
                                                            F
It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it could have been right

It could be wrong could be....

(Chorus 1)

F              C
Love is our resistance
                                                    G
They keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down
Am                      G         F
Hold me, our lips must always be sealed

(Bridge)

F               C
The night has reached its end
     G
We can't pretend

(Chorus 2)

         F  Am  G
We must run
         F  Am  G
We must run
              F  Am  G  E  F
It's time to run

(Outro)

 A                 Dm
Take us away from here
    A             Dm       C
Protect us from further harm
   G A5 B5 C5 D5 F5
Resistance
