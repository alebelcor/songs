(Intro)

D#  D#  Gm  Gm
D#  D#  Gm  Gm

(Verse 1)

D#                                Gm
   I know you've suffered, but I don't want you to hide
D#                                 Gm
   It's cold and loveless, I won't let you be denied

(Bridge)

D#
Soothing
     Gm
I'll make you feel pure
D#
Trust me
Gm
You can be sure

(Chorus)

Cm           D#             Gm               A#
   I want to reconcile the violence in your heart
Cm           D#               Gm                  A#
   I want to recognise your beauty is not just a mask
Cm           D#           Gm               A#
   I want to exorcise the demons from your past
Cm           D#          Gm            A#              D#
   I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart

(Verse 2)

D#                                    Gm
   You trick your lovers that you're wicked and divine
D#                                Gm
   You may be a sinner, but your innocence is mine

(Bridge)

D#
Please me
Gm
Show me how it's done
D#
Tease me
Gm
You are the one

(Chorus)

Cm           D#             Gm               A#
   I want to reconcile the violence in your heart
Cm           D#               Gm                  A#
   I want to recognise your beauty is not just a mask
Cm           D#           Gm               A#
   I want to exorcise the demons from your past
Cm           D#          Gm            A#              D#
   I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart

Cm           D#               Gm                  A#
   I want to recognise your beauty is not just a mask
Cm           D#           Gm               A#
   I want to exorcise the demons from your past
Cm           D#          Gm            A#              D#
