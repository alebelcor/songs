(Intro)

Cm  Cm  Cm  Cm
Cm  D#  G#  Fm (6x)

(Verse 1)

Cm D#    G#             Fm
Fear and panic in the air
        Cm      D#
I want to be free
         G#             Fm
From desolation and despair
      Cm D#     G#             Fm
And I feel like everything I sow
        Cm         D#
Is being swept away
         G#                Fm
Well I refuse to let you go

(Bridge)
              Cm D# G# Fm
I can't get it right
      Cm D# G# Fm
Get it right

Since I met you

(Interlude)

Cm  D#  G#  Fm
Cm  D#  G#  Fm

(Chorus)

Cm    D#          G#  Fm
Loneliness be over
              Cm     D#          G#  Fm
When will this loneliness be over?

(Interlude)

(Verse 2)

Cm D#     G#                 Fm
Life will flash before my eyes
               Cm  D#
So scattered and lost
           G#             Fm
I want to touch the other side
       Cm D# G#                 Fm
And no one thinks they are to blame
            Cm D#
Why can't we see
              G#                 Fm
That when we bleed we bleed the same?

(Bridge)
              Cm D# G# Fm
I can't get it right
      Cm D# G# Fm
Get it right

Since I met you

(Interlude)

Cm  D#  G#  Fm
Cm  D#  G#  Fm

(Chorus)

Cm    D#          G#  Fm
Loneliness be over
              Cm     D#          G#  Fm
When will this loneliness be over?
Cm    D#          G#  Fm
Loneliness be over
              Cm     D#          G#  Fm
When will this loneliness be over?
