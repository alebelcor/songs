[Intro]

G#m  E  C#m  E F#
G#m  E  C#m  F#

G#m  E  C#m  E F#
G#m  E  C#m  F#

[Verse 1]

G#m
   I won't tell
        G#m
I won't show
                            F#
I won't give them what they want
                  C#m            C#m
No one else will find our little secret

[Verse 2]

G#m
   Not a word
            G#m
My lips are sealed
                         F#
It won't help to torture me
                      C#m              C#m
No kind of pain will make me talk this night

[Bridge]

E                   C#m
   Try to see it my eyes
                           A
But I will only give you lies
                             G#m    F#        E
You should know that this is only a waste of time
                        C#m
Try to read it from my mind
                           A
There is nothing you will find
                  E       F#
Before you really understand

[Chorus]

G#m      E     C#m
When we all believe
        E       F#
I will give you answers
G#m      E      C#m
We will all deceive
     F#
The truth about our time

[Interlude]

G#m  E  C#m  E F#
G#m  E  C#m  F#

[Verse 3]

G#m                              G#m
   Never too late to change your ways
                               F#
Never too late to change your mind
                     C#m           C#m
No need to keep your secret to yourself

[Verse 4]

G#m                        G#m
   No more time to fool around
                          F#
No more time for stupid games
                C#m           C#m
The moment has come to let it out

[Bridge]

E                   C#m
   Try to see it my eyes
                           A
But I will only give you lies
                             G#m    F#        E
You should know that this is only a waste of time
                        C#m
Try to read it from my mind
                           A
There is nothing you will find
                  E       F#
Before you really understand

[Chorus]

G#m      E     C#m
When we all believe
        E       F#
I will give you answers
G#m      E      C#m
We will all deceive
     F#
The truth about our time
