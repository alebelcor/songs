She was like April sky

Sunrise in her eyes

Child of light

Shining star

Fire in her heart

Brightest day

Melting snow

Breaking through the chill

He was like frozen sky
Am         Am
In October night
Dm
Darkest cloud
Dm
Endless storm
C                C
Raining from his heart
Gm
Coldest moon

Deepest blue

Tearing down the spring

[Chorus 1]

F                A#
   Like hate and love
Gm          C
   Worlds apart
Am            Dm
   This fatal love

Was like poison
       C
Right from the start

   Like light and dark

[Verse 3]

Dm           Dm
We were like loaded guns
Am             Am
Sacrificed our lives
Dm           Dm
We were like love undone
C             C
Craving to entwine
Gm
Fatal touch
Gm
Final thrill
Dm                Dm
Love was bound to kill
