[Intro]

D  D  F#m  F#m
Bm  Bm  F#m  F#m

[Verse 1]

     Bm   F#m
No sleep
                     Bm                   F#m
No sleep until I am done with finding the answer
       Bm   F#m
Won't stop
                     Bm                  F#m
Won't stop before I find a cure for this cancer

[Pre-chorus]

D           F#m
Sometimes
                  Bm                F#m
I feel like going down and so disconnected
D         F#m
Somehow
                 Bm            F#m
I know that I am haunted to be wanted

[Chorus 1]
             D
I've been watching
             F#m
I've been waiting
          Bm          F#m
In the shadows for my time
              D
I've been searching
            F#m
I've been living
         Bm          F#m
For tomorrows all my life

[Interlude]

D  F#m           Bm   F#m
       In the shadows
D  F#m           Bm   F#m
       In the shadows

[Verse 2]

     Bm   F#m
They say
                      Bm               F#m
That I must learn to kill before I can feel safe
    Bm   F#m
But I
                   Bm                  F#m
I'd rather kill myself than turn into their slave

[Pre-chorus]

D           F#m
Sometimes
                     Bm                   F#m
I feel that I should go and play with the thunder
D         F#m
Somehow
                   Bm                  F#m
I just don't wanna stay and wait for a wonder

[Chorus 2]
             D
I've been watching
             F#m
I've been waiting
          Bm          F#m
In the shadows for my time
              D
I've been searching
            F#m
I've been living
         Bm          F#m
For tomorrows all my life

[Interlude]

D                                F#m
Lately I been walking walking in circles, watching waiting for something
Bm                                     F#m
Feel me touch me heal me, come take me higher

[Chorus 3]
             D
I've been watching
             F#m
I've been waiting
          Bm          F#m
In the shadows for my time
              D
I've been searching
            F#m
I've been living
         Bm          F#m
For tomorrows all my life
             D       F#m
I've been watching
             Bm     F#m
I've been waiting
              D       F#m
I've been searching
            Bm           F#m
I've been living for tomorrows

[Outro]

D  F#m           Bm   F#m
       In the shadows
D  F#m           Bm   F#m
       In the shadows
             D
I've been waiting
