[Verse 1]

Bm
   I didn't want to be the one to forget
A
   I thought of everything I'd never regret
G
   A little time with you is all that I get
Em
   That's all we need because it's all we can take

[Verse 2]

Bm
   One thing I never see the same when your 'round
A
   I don't believe in him—his lips on the ground
G
   I wanna take you to that place in the "Roche"
Em
   But no one gives us any time anymore

[Verse 3]

Bm
   He ask me once if I'd look in on his dog
A
   You made an offer for it, then you ran off
G
   I got this picture of us kids in my head
Em
   And all I hear is the last thing that you said

[Bridge]

   Bm
"I listened to your problems

Now listen to mine"
          A
I didn't want to anymore, oh oh oh

[Chorus 1]

Bm             Bm        A      G
   And we will never be alone again
            G            F#m   Em
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
       Em             Em       A
Kinda counted on you being a friend
      F#m                   Bm
Can I give it up or give it away
       Bm                A        G
Now I thought about what I wanna say
       G           F#m           Em
But I never really know where to go
      Em        Em         A
So I chained myself to a friend
         F#m                     Bm
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
            Bm        A      G
And we will never be alone again
            G            F#m   Em
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
       Em             Em       A
Kinda counted on you being a friend
      F#m                   Bm
Can I give it up or give it away
       Bm                A        G
Now I thought about what I wanna say
       G           F#m           Em
But I never really know where to go
      Em        Em         A    F#m
So I chained myself to a friend

[Interlude]
      G          Em
Some more again

[Verse 4]

Bm
   It didn't matter what they wanted to see
A
   He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
G
   The summer memory that just never dies
Em
   We worked too long and hard to give it no time

[Verse 5]

Bm
   He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
A
   Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
G
   He runs his scissor at the seem in the wall
Em
   He cannot break it down or else he would fall

[Bridge]

Bm                          A
   One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold
G                       Em
Take it, I don't wanna sing anymore

[Solo]

[Chorus 2]

Bm Bm   A      G     G    F#m    Em
I don't understand, don't get upset
Em  Em        A  F#m
I'm not with you
Bm    Bm   A     G
We're swimming around,
G    F#m   Em   Em      Em    A  F#m
It's all I do, when I'm with you

[Chorus 1]
