[Verse 2]

G#m
   You are the night
                  G#m F# E
You are the ocean
                                   E D#m C#m
You are the light behind the cloud
                                  C#m D#m E
You are the end and the beginning
                           F#
A world where time is not allowed

G#m                                     G#m F# E
   There's no such thing as competition
                                E D#m C#m
To find our way we lose control
                                 C#m D#m E
Remember love's our only mission
                          F#
This is a journey of the soul

G#m                                        G#m F# E
   The perfect song is framed with silence
                               E D#m C#m
It speaks of places never seen
                                     C#m D#m E
Your home's a promise long forgotten
                               F#
It is the birthplace of your dreams
