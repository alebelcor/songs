[Verse 1]

                        Bm
Like the legend of the phoenix
D                  F#m
   All ends with beginnings
E                         Bm
   What keeps the planet spinning
D                       F#m      E
   The force from the beginning

[Pre-chorus]

Bm              D
We've come too far
        F#m       E
To give up who we are
    Bm              D
So let's raise the bar
        F#m          E
And our cups to the stars

[Chorus]

Bm                               D
   She's up all night to the sun, I'm up all night to get some
F#m                                E
   She's up all night for good fun, I'm up all night to get lucky
Bm                               D
   We're up all night to the sun, we're up all night to get some
F#m                               E
   We're up all night for good fun, we're up all night to get lucky
Bm                                D
   We're up all night to get lucky, we're up all night to get lucky
F#m                                E
   We're up all night to get lucky, we're up all night to get lucky

[Interlude]

Bm  D  F#m  E

[Verse 2]

                   Bm
The present has no ribbon
D                    F#m
  Your gift keeps on giving
E                   Bm      D
  What is this I'm feeling?
D                           F#m      E
  If you want to leave, I'm with it

[Pre-chorus]

Bm              D
We've come too far
        F#m       E
To give up who we are
    Bm              D
So let's raise the bar
        F#m          E
And our cups to the stars

[Chorus]

Bm                               D
   She's up all night to the sun, I'm up all night to get some
F#m                                E
   She's up all night for good fun, I'm up all night to get lucky
Bm                               D
   We're up all night to the sun, we're up all night to get some
F#m                               E
   We're up all night for good fun, we're up all night to get lucky
Bm                                D
   We're up all night to get lucky, we're up all night to get lucky
F#m                                E
   We're up all night to get lucky, we're up all night to get lucky
