[Verse 1]

Bm                    G                         Em   A
   There are so many things that I don't understand
Bm                        G                    Em   A
   There's a world within me that I cannot explain
Bm                  G                            Em   A
   Many rooms to explore, but the doors look the same
Bm                   G                Em    A
   I am lost I can't even remember my name

[Chorus]

Bm
I've been, for some time
 G
Looking for someone
Em
I need to know now
  A
Please tell me who I am
Bm
I've been, for some time
 G
Looking for someone
Em
I need to know now
  A
Please tell me who I am

[Verse 2]

Bm                    G                         Em   A
   There are so many things that I don't understand
Bm                        G                    Em   A
   There's a world within me that I cannot explain
Bm                  G                            Em
   Many rooms to explore, but the doors look the same
                A
(Where are the locks to try the key?)
Bm                   G                Em
   I am lost I can't even remember my name
               A
(And I wonder why)

[Chorus]

Bm
I've been, for some time
 G
Looking for someone
Em
I need to know now
  A
Please tell me who I am
Bm
I've been, for some time
 G
Looking for someone
Em
I need to know now
  A
Please tell me who I am
Bm
I've been, for some time
 G
Looking for someone
Em
I need to know now
  A
Please tell me who I am
Bm
I've been, for some time
 G
Looking for someone
Em
I need to know now
  A
Please tell me who I am
